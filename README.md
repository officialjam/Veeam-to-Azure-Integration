# Veeam-to-Azure-Integration

Firstly, we need to start off with what veeam is: Veeam is a comprehensive data protection and disaster recovery solution designed to back up, replicate, and restore workloads in various environments, including on-premises, hybrid, and cloud-based infrastructures.It plays a critical role in ensuring business continuity by providing features such as: Backup and restore, replication, integration with cloud providers, moniotoring and reporting and automation.Veeam provides seamless integration with major cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, allowing for efficient data protection, disaster recovery, and cost-effective backup storage. For this project, we will be integrating veeam to azure to backup a container in a blob storage. 

<h1>Environments and Technologies Used</h1>

- **Microsoft Azure**:
  - **Storage Account**: Used for cloud-based backup storage with Azure Blob, configured for version-level immutability.
  
- **Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition**:
  - **Version**: 12.2.0.334
  - Installed on a **Windows Server VM** hosted on Hyper-V for managing backups and replication to Azure.

- **Physical Server**:
  - **Host OS**: Windows Server 
  - Virtualization: **Windows Hyper-V**, which hosts multiple virtual machines, including the Windows VM running Veeam.

- **Windows Server VM** (Hosted on Hyper-V):
  - **VM OS**: Windows Server 2019 standard evaluation
  - **Role**: Dedicated to hosting **Veeam Backup & Replication** for handling local and Azure backup operations.

 <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

- Ensure you have a Veeam Backup & Replication server installed and running
- An active Microsoft Azure account with sufficient permissions
- Set up Azure Blob Storage for long-term backup storage (if needed)

 <h2>Set-up an azure storage account</h2>
 
- Log in to the Azure portal
- Click storage account

- click create 
<img width="1440" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14a746f5-9352-4eff-8b80-df39b794403c">

- review details( Resource group, storage name, redudancy etc)

- While creating, go to "Data protection" option and enable versioning for blobs and also uncheck the following

- Once the Storage Account is created, go to the Containers section under your Storage Account, Press the create button and give the container a name and then click the option to enable version-level immutability support (Enabling version-level immutability when integrating Azure with Veeam is critical for ensuring the integrity and security of backup data. This setting ensures that your backups are protected against tampering, accidental deletion, or malicious actions such as ransomware attacks). Then click create

- under properties check and make sure version level immutability is enabled

- in order for veeam to be able to acces your storage account, you will need an access key. Navigate to your storage account, click on security and networking and then select access keys. Click the option to rotate keys and then press the show button and copy the key and connection string down somewhere( we will be needing it in veeam soon for connection to azure storage account)

<h2>Connect Azure Storage to Veeam</h2>

It is assumed that we alraedy have veeam installed and ready for integration. 

- Open Veeam Backup & Replication Console
- Navigate to backup infrastructure and click add repository
- A pop up should show and youll be tasked to enter a name you want to give the repository
<img width="1440" alt="21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c001bb4-b55c-4d10-b061-06cb50282e4c">

- The next page shows where the acccess key would be entered for the integration to be established
<img width="1440" alt="22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6045d5c6-a34e-412a-a8fa-8cd0e32fe657">

- select the container you want to use and choose to selsct or create a new folder. You willl see the option to enable backups to be immutable, selsct it and choose the days that suits you

- Finish up the next stpes by adjusting the configurations to your needs. The finishing step should look like this

- After finishing up, your azure repisotory should show in the backup repository like this

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

In this documentation, we covered the end-to-end process of integrating Azure with Veeam for cloud-based backups. This setup provides a secure, scalable, and reliable solution for long-term data retention and disaster recovery, leveraging Azure's storage capabilities and Veeam's backup management tools.

<h4>Best Practices and Considerations</h4>

- **Security Recommendations**: Ensure proper access controls are in place, consider enabling immutability on the backup storage, and utilize encryption to secure data.
- **Performance Tips**: Optimize backup performance by choosing appropriate storage tiers for your access needs and scheduling backups during low-traffic times.


<h5>Troubleshooting Tips</h5>

- **Common Issues**:
  - **Proxy Errors**: Ensure that proxy settings are properly configured and that the proxy VM has sufficient permissions.
  - **Permission Issues**: Confirm that the storage account and containers have the correct access permissions for Veeam.
  - **Immutability Error**: If you encounter an error related to immutability (e.g., "Enable backup immutability because immutability feature is enabled on the selected container"), double-check that immutability is correctly set at the container level in Azure. Verify that Veeamâ€™s repository settings are also configured to align with the immutability setting in Azure.
